## The Client

S&V Memorials is a family-owned business in Windsor specializing in custom headstones and memorials. Run by Slavko Vidakovic for over a decade, they're known for craftsmanship and compassionate service during difficult times.

Before we worked together, they relied on word-of-mouth and local advertising. It worked, but they wanted a website to showcase their work and make it easier for families to find them.

## What We Built

S&V needed a website that reflected their dedication to quality while being easy for grieving families to navigate. We built them a custom Astro site with a portfolio gallery and simple contact options.

**What we delivered:**
- [Custom Astro website](/web-development) with portfolio gallery
- Organized categories (headstones, plaques, benches)
- Contact form and service request feature
- [Secure hosting](/web-hosting) with 99.9% uptime

The portfolio gallery lets them showcase their work and add new projects as they complete them. Families can browse their craftsmanship and reach out when they're ready. Astro's performance ensures the site loads fast even with high-quality images.

## What Slavko Said

> *"RVB did an outstanding job on our website. The team was professional, creative, and attentive to our vision. We felt supported every step of the way and couldn't be happier with our results. Highly recommend their web development services!"*

We're grateful to have worked on something this meaningful.
