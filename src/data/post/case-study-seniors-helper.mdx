## The Client

Seniors Helper is run by Donna Irving in Burlington. She provides personalized cleaning services for seniors' homes — helping them maintain clean, safe, and comfortable living spaces.

Donna relied on word-of-mouth and local ads, which worked fine. But she wanted a simple online presence where people could find her and reach out easily.

## What We Built

Donna needed something simple — a one-page site that worked as a digital business card. No fancy features, just the basics done right.

**What we delivered:**
- [Simple one-page Astro site](/web-development)
- Contact form for easy inquiries
- [Yearly hosting](/web-hosting) to keep it secure and online

The design reflects Donna's warm personality — clean, welcoming, and easy to navigate. Everything a potential client needs to know is right there on one page. Built with Astro, it loads lightning fast.

## What Donna Said

> *"Petar worked so hard for me. I'm almost 60 and retired. I needed one page simple website for my new business. He listened and created perfectly what I needed. He's very patient as I am not tech savvy! Thank you!!"*

Sometimes you don't need a massive website. You just need something that works.
