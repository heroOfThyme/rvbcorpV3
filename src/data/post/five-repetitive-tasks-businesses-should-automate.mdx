## Introduction

There’s a tool available from RVB that will give you a distinct advantage over competitors – it saves you more of life’s most valuable resource: **time**.

Business Process Automation (BPA) is where **advanced** technology meets **convenience** – a computer program designed to handle basic business processes without need for a human to complete those tasks. Instead of *replacing* an employee, BPA is designed to *assist* them with those mundane and tedious tasks. That includes onboarding employees and customers, IT services, and low-level marketing tasks.

## Here are the tasks RVB Data Sciences can automate for your business:

### Automate Manufacturing Processes
Supply chain? Quality assurance? **Everything** can be automated. Why send an email to your vendors every time you need parts? Once you get to certain stock levels, we can automatically generate a PO and send it away. Need to approve it? We can add that step. <u>There are not many limitations.</u>

### Customer Inquiries
Automation answers basic questions and **streamlines** the rest. Want to direct their tech questions to your IT support specialist? AI chat-bots and automated directories make this easy. We tune the AI program to match your operations. 

### CRMs, Finance, HR, and Many Other Operations
All of these systems can be integrated. You can have invoices, services tickets, company details, product details, email history chains, benefits, and a plethora of other important information **in one area**. This not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and consistency in your business operations. 

### Compliance and Reporting
Automating compliance reporting allows companies to **accurately** and **efficiently** collect data, generate reports, and ensure timely submissions to regulatory bodies. Automated systems also improve **audit readiness** by maintaining detailed records, provide real-time monitoring to prevent violations, and reduce operational costs. 

### Systems Integration 
Integrating systems, such as connecting a Shopify store to a CRM, streamlines business operations by automating the **flow of data** between platforms. This integration ensures that customer information, order details, and inventory levels are **automatically** updated across both systems, **reducing** manual data entry and the risk of **errors**.
