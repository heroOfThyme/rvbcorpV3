## Introduction

If ‘Content is King’, Astro is its royal advisor. It’s an all-in-one website framework that starts as an easy-to-use tool and ends in a speedy, responsive site. That makes it perfect for **content-focused websites**, including blogs and media outlets. It’s also a great tool for keeping your content well organized and detectable in search engines.

The speed and efficiency don’t stop at your website’s performance. Astro sites are quick to build and launch; they are also simple to maintain and keep up to date with the latest technologies. 

RVB Data Sciences offers Astro as a framework option for developing your website. Our team will help you reap all the benefits of a finished Astro site, including elevated Search Engine Optimization (SEO), regular content blogs, scalability, and much more. We’ve served clients across Ontario, including Legacy Exteriors Inc. and S&V Memorials in Windsor, and Seniors Helper in Burlington.

Let’s define a web development framework and help set you up for success in using Astro to build your business online.


## Defining a Web Development Framework
---

Web development frameworks are tools and resources that enable developers to build and manage web applications, web services, websites, and more. It also allows software developers to develop APIs (code that allows two software programs to communicate with one another and function).

Frameworks like Astro offer useful features and functionality. Two benefits specific to Astro include a wide support of user interfaces and the ‘Astro Islands’ component-based web architecture builder. Astro Islands helps componentize and optimize your content. 

Astro even combines frontend and backend code execution, mixing JavaScript and HTML. Any developer will thank you for making their job easier, and for letting them focus on the things that matter.

For more details on the benefits of using a web development framework like Astro, read through this blog by Robert Sheldon at TechTarget.

## The Benefits of Being Friends with Astro

As an all-in-one web framework, Astro comes with many benefits when it comes to building your site, hosting it, and ranking higher in Google. Each section below will show areas where Astro performs better than the competition.

For additional benefits, read through this guide by Adele Michael on Medium.

## It Won’t Leave you hanging thanks to fast load times
---

Astro is ideal for building a content-heavy website, including blogs, marketing sites, portfolios, and even niche news outlets. That’s because, where some web frameworks also function in creating interactive web applications, Astro sticks to its purpose and ensures the content on your site is organized to keep it fast and efficient. 

E-commerce shops can benefit from faster load times. Your product may speak for itself, but unless it can reach your customers quickly, it may as well not exist. It will also assist with SEO – the faster your site loads, the closer it crawls or leaps towards that ‘first’ position in the search engine results pages.

Of course, there’s more to SEO than having the content load quickly (there are hundreds of other factors) but a well-written blog post supported by Astro’s framework can be a real one-two punch. In the bustling world of the internet, every second counts towards moving a buyer through the sales funnel, or for a potential employer to consider hiring you off your portfolio.

Whether you’re located in Burlington, Guelph, Milton, Hamilton, Windsor, or somewhere else in Canada, you can benefit from speed when your website is designed by RVB Data Sciences. All sites are scalable and can grow with your business in terms of traffic and any new content you would like to place. Astro just makes it easier for us to do so.

## Astro’s server-side rendering delivers
---

Astro uses ‘server-side rendering’ – a method used in traditional frameworks including WordPress and PHP. Sure, server-side rendering has been around a long time and isn’t the latest cutting-edge technology … but unlike other systems, you won’t need to learn a new coding language just to use it! Everything is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Typescript, making it easier to access, code, and use.

Other modern web development frameworks tend to use ‘client-side rendering’, meaning the entire website is built within a web browser. Frameworks using client-side rendering include Next.js, SvelteKit, Next, and Remix. There’s a right and wrong time to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering – each has its uses.

Client-side rendering is a more modern approach with notable benefits, yet it has a huge disadvantage that affects content-heavy sites: the bloat can affect your site’s performance and needlessly lengthen load times. 

Keep this in mind: Astro may be lacking some of the bells and whistles of a framework using client-side rendering, but those bells and whistles can add up and affect your performance. Everything that goes into your site is another thing for the server and then browser to load – that’s worth keeping in mind if you’re looking to make a ‘pretty’ website with lots of graphics and moving parts.

## It relies less on JavaScript and more on your content
---

Thanks to its amazing tools and efficiency, it’s hard to make a slow site with an Astro framework! We’ve learned Astro stands out among its peers by prioritizing content, its server-first MPA architecture, and speed. That’s because your Astro site starts simple, though you can make it as complex as you’d like.

It’s easy for a web development framework to make a site look awesome, but they’ll often load slowly in practice. Much of that is thanks to JavaScript. Though Astro is a JavaScript web framework, it only includes the JavaScript you need to run your site – no extras, no nonsense. That said, Astro websites are anything but boring!

One example of an Astro-run framework done right is Google. Have you ever noticed how simple the basic Google Search page is? As enormous and dominant as Google is, everything about it appears basic. There’s a search field, the logo, and a few simple buttons – and once you’ve clicked search, you’ll notice the results pages load in the blink of an eye.

Other businesses using an Astro framework include Porsche, The Guardian, NordVPN, and Microsoft. Looking at Porsche Canada’s homepage, there are images of Porsches we’d love to drive, but no bloaty components, no taxing widgets, and no extra graphics. Their site is almost as fast as their cars.

For more details on how to structure JavaScript in your Astro website, check out this amazing article on Knowledge Hub. Of course, you won’t need to code your own site or learn JavaScript when you choose RVB!

Astro is accessible and user-friendly, letting developers at all levels reap its benefits. For example, it’s easy to connect and use UI components languages with Astro – like React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, and Lit. The integration between these tools and your Astro-powered website is seamless.

Astro is fully customizable using your favourite tools, including CSS libraries, special themes, and more. It’s a very ‘bring your own components’ system in that Astro supports every other major framework on the market. That said, Astro is an all-in-one, fully featured solution to running a website: you’ll already have everything you need to build a modern website using Astro.

The ease of use and accessibility make it perfect for blogs, portfolios, and online documents. What may surprise you, however, is Astro can construct an amazing website for your business, too. Browse through the simple e-commerce themes on Astro’s website and notice how effective the messaging and product images are thanks to the framework’s simplicity.
